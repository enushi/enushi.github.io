My name is Elio Nushi. I completed my Bachelor's and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Science with a particular focus in Data Science, Machine Learning and Algorithms. I like to explore new and interesting applications of Mathematics in the real world. My recent research interests include Personalised Medicine, Computational Biology and System Biology which introduce mathematical rigor in the study of living organisms. I am currently pursuing my doctoral studies at the University of Helsinki under the supervision of [Antti Honkela](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ahonkela/) where I develop probabilistic models for doing predictions on time series of different omics data.
