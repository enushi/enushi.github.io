We propose a Bayesian approach based on Gaussian process
regression modeling to address this challenge. We employ this method to perform time
annotation in legacy Clostridium botulinum microarray experiments, which were initially
annotated based on growth phases, utilizing recently collected RNA-Seq time series data
comprising multiple replicates as reference. We also test the performance of the method on
RNA-Seq data by using the experiments collected on even time points as the training set and
the rest as the validation set. Furthermore, we assess the methodâ€™s robustness to
measurement errors by applying it to synthetically generated data with varying levels of
noise.
